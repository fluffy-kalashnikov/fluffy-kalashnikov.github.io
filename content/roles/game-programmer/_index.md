Hi! I'm a game programmer experienced with tools and pipelines from Tjörn. I'm a very analytical person with a fascination for computer graphics, content pipelines and procedural content generation. 

I will always refer to myself as a programmer at heart, but I have taken great interest in graphics and animation as well! I enjoy collaborating with people from a wide variety of disciplines and I'm always eager to learn something new.

Hope to see you soon!
