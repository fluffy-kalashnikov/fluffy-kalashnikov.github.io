Hi! I'm a technical artist and game programmer from Tjörn. I'm a very analytical person with a strong fascination for graphics programming, content pipelines and custom tools development. 

I'm a programmer at heart, but I have taken great interest in graphics and animation as well! I enjoy collaborating with people from a wide variety of disciplines and I'm always eager to learn something new.

Hope to see you soon!
