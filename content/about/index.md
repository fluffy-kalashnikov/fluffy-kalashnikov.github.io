Hiya! I'm a technical artist and game programmer from Tj√∂rn. I'm a very analytical (possibly pedantic) person with a strong fascination for graphics programming, content pipelines and custom tools development. 

I'm a talented programmer at heart, but I have great interest in graphics and animation as well. I enjoy collaborating with people from a great variety of disciplines and I'm always eager to learn something new.

Hope to see you soon!
