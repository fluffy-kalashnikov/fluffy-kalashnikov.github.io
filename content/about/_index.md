Hi! I'm Ivar Sidorsson. I'm a game developer from southern Tj�rn, 
a centerpiece in the Swedish Bohusl�n archipelago!

I was introduced to the gaming landscape through New Super Mario Bros 
and Minecraft on a laptop that barely ran at 24 FPS, and since then I 
have grown very fond of more causal first person shooters as 
Titanfall 2 and Team Fortress 2.

# My Game Development Journey
My game development journey began at LBS Gothenburg where I learnt 
to make games in Unity. I got completely hooked and prototyped many 
Unity gameplay systems in my spare time. Inspired by Nelson Sextons devlogs of 
[Unturned II](https://blog.smartlydressedgames.com/category/unturned-ii/page/10/), 
I decided to learn Unreal Engine and the multiplayer architecture 
through Udemy courses provided by GameDev.tv. I became quite aquainted 
with Unreal C++ and had a solid understanding of how to use 
the Unreal Build System, UMG, Slate, Online Subsystem Steam, Asset Management and more.

When I was figuring out what I wanted to do next after my education at 
LBS Gothenburg, I was concerned about the fact that I still had no 
experience developing applications outside of engines as Unity and 
Unreal. I also had problems with overscoping, and reverse-engineering 
how Lyra and the Gameplay Ability System worked in Unreal Engine never 
proved fruitful for FINISHING games. When I became conscious of 
The Game Assembly's existance and realized the games are made in 
engines/editors you make yourself as well, I was frightened. 
Physics, visual scripting, visual effects, rendering pipelines, 
pathfinding, agent behaviors and more felt like black magic provided 
by Unity and Unreal, and coping with the complexity of the architecture 
while simultaneosly producing 8 titles at a very rapid pace sounded insane.

Today, after 3 years at The Game Assembly, I can confidently say 
that I have a thorough understanding of game engine architectures 
and how to implement them. I feel competent at scoping game projects 
and collaborating with other disciplines to finish them. With my 
primary interest in computer graphics and engine architectures, 
I am now truly a multiclasser!
