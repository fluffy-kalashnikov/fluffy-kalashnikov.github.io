# Stella & Orbit Take Flight
Stella & Orbit - Take Flight is a third person platformer where you as Stella cooperate with Orbit to flee the Lunar Police and become a pirate. Some of the highlights was integrating Houdini, creating the depth fog and implementing gameplay-driven shaders as the power cable and player status effects.
