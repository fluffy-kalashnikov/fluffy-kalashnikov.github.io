# Spite Parasite
Spite Parasite is an ARPG where you use your god-given powers to cleanse an infested ancient civilization deep in the jungle. As our programmers initially were busy writing Tre Rader Kod, our custom game engine, we asissted in shaping and documenting the pipeline. My primary responsibility was to work on the Unreal Engine exporter, which you can read more about [here](/portfolio/unreal-engine-exporter).
