Your Rabbit Died is a puzzle game built for mobile. It was the second game project 
at [The Game Assembly](https://thegameassembly.com) and was made in Unity as well.

I was responsible for
* Building/shipping
* Dialogue
* Grid system/tooling
* Sound system/playback
* Mobile support

I am particularly proud of the grid system/tooling and automatically generating 
connections based on the grid layout. I purposely attempted to achieve an agile 
workflow and managed to create a working prototype within 3 days. During production 
the system saw many improvements to functionality and workflow based on 
level designer feedback. Some improvements included
* Swapping editor build button to build keybind
* Height support
* Duplicate tile validation
* Connection/path visualization
* Orientation visualization
