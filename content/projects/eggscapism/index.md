Eggscapism is a narrative puzzler roughly 2 minutes in length. It was my fifth project 
at [The Game Assembly](https://thegameassembly.com), and it was the first project where 
we used our own game engines made from scratch. The main purpose of the project was to
establish a proper pipeline to make a game with the new game engine.
