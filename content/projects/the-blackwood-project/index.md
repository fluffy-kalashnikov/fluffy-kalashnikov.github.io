# The Blackwood Project
[The Blackwood Project](https://virendrar.itch.io/the-darkwood-project) is an isometric action game where you're an agent investigating a distress signal on the inside of a mansion, armed with a flashlight and revolver. I was mostly focused on writing shaders for post process, materials and visual effects.

  *  Outline for interactibles + highlight for pickups
  *  Multi-layered base material for artists
  *  Scripting flickering lights
  *  Helping with Houdini cloth sims
