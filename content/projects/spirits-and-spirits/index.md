# Spirits & Spirits
Spirits & Spirits is a cooperative liqour mixing game where you serve rowdy spirits that have risen again for one final dance-off.

I was primarily responsible for 
  * Station processing
  * Ingredient combination system
  * Customer recipes system
  * Station/customer alerts
  * Graphics engine maintenance

During preproduction we decided to use the engine as-is and not implement larger feature requests. This allowed the programming team to almost focus exclusively on gameplay programming, and I think this really shows in the final product! I was personally responsible for implementing the recipes system and the station/ingredient processing required to fulfill them, and I'm quite happy with the result.
